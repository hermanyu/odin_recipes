            Coat a large baking dish with cooking spray; 
            set aside. Preheat oven to 475°F. Cut tops off bell peppers; 
            set tops aside. Using a paring knife, carefully remove 
            the membranes and seeds from bell peppers. 
            Arrange peppers about 2 inches apart in prepared baking dish. 
            Place tops on empty peppers. Cover baking dish tightly with 
            aluminum foil; bake 15 minutes. Remove from oven; cool slightly.

            Meanwhile, heat large nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot. 
            Add Ground Beef, onion and garlic; cook 3 to 4 minutes, 
            breaking beef into 1/2 inch crumbles and stirring occasionally. 
            Stir in tomatoes, rice, tomato paste, dried parsley, salt 
            and black pepper; cook 3 to 4 minutes until heated through, 
            stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove pepper tops. Divide beef mixture evenly among peppers; 
            replace tops. Bake in 475°F oven 17 to 22 minutes until 
            instant-read thermometer inserted into center of beef mixture 
            registers 160°F and bell peppers are tender. 
            Garnish with parsley, if desired.
